Hello one and all!<p />The next meetup is on November the 1st so it&#39;s about time to start planning! What would people like to see? Another practical session? We could attempt the Battleships task LRUG are running tonight? Does anyone have anything they&#39;d like to talk about? <p /> Couple of options I was thinking of:<p />1) Explore some of the more &quot;obscure&quot; areas of Ruby, some of the crevices of the Stdlib etc. <p />2) A talk on the work I&#39;ve done recently on the Rails 3.1 asset pipeline and how I&#39;ve used it to create a white label system. <p /> 3) A bit of a play around with a library that just appeared called Hornets Eye: <a href="http://www.wedesoft.demon.co.uk/hornetseye-api/">http://www.wedesoft.demon.co.uk/hornetseye-api/</a><p />Anyways, let me know what you think!<p /> Cheers<p />Tom
