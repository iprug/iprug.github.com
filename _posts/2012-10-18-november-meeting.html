<p>The next meeting will be on Tuesday the 6th of November. Usual time and place &ndash; The Brewery Tap, 7.30ish for an 8pm start.</p>
<p>Still looking for volunteers to talk &ndash; if there's something vaguely ruby-related you could give a presentation about, please get in touch! Failing that, anyone got any original ideas for some kind of programming activity we could do?</p>
