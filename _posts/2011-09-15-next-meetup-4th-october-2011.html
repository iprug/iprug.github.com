<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>:</p>
<p><span style="font-family: mceinline;">We now have two talks lined up, Kerry Buckley and Henry Garner have kindly volunteered to talk this month. Kerry is going to talk about how to make your tests run faster, whilst Henry will give a talk entitled "Lessons in Hardware Hacking" and he'll be bringing along his Maker Bot for us to coo over. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: mceinline;">Thanks very much to you both, and I look forward to hearing both!</span></p>

<p><strong>Tuesday October 4th, 7:30pm @ The Brewery Tap<br /></strong></p>

<p>Hi everybody!</p>
<p />
<div>This is a bit of a call for speakers really! The next meetup is fast approaching and I've not got anything sorted yet. Does anybody have a presentation they'd like to give or any work they'd like to talk about?</div>
<p />
<div>So, the date will be Tuesday October 4th, 7:30pm as usual, and at the Brewery Tap (need to confirm this yet though)</div>
<p />
<div>Cheers</div>
