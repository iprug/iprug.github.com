<p>Well the Mayans <em>were</em> wrong, we safely made it to 2013, and it's time for the first IPRUG of the year. Usual time and place, but a week later than usual &ndash; Tuesday 8 January.</p>
<p>Only one talk confirmed so far &ndash; Adam will be passing on some tips for writing beautiful code!</p>
<p>If anyone else has a talk up their sleeve let me know, otherwise you'll either be subjected to some poorly-prepared nonsense from me on some random subject, or maybe just have extra drinking time afterwards.</p>
<p>Even if you don't have anything you can be ready to talk about by Tuesday, please have a think about doing something in a future month. We seem to be getting short of volunteer presenters, and I'm not as good as Tom at pressganging people into it!</p>
