To reduce the amount of confusion caused by our new "a couple of weeks after
FESuffolk" slot (not helped by me usually forgetting to tweet until the last
minute), I've added a thingy to the header up there to tell you when the next
one is due. And to prove how inclusive we are, the
[code](https://github.com/iprug/iprug.github.io/blob/master/assets/js/iprug.js)
and
[tests](https://github.com/iprug/iprug.github.io/blob/master/spec/javascripts/iprug_spec.js)
are
all in Javascript.
