<p>Hello!</p>
<p />
<div>Our next meetup will be on the 3rd July, at The Brewery Tap in Ipswich (as per usual).&nbsp;</div>
<p />
<div><strong>Update: We have another volunteer!</strong></div>
<p />
<div><strong>Matthew Bennett </strong>is going to give us a talk called <span style="">"Testing the sconover/wrong way", so it looks like a rather test based session this one!&nbsp;</span></div>
<p />
<div>We have one volunteer already:&nbsp;<strong><span style="color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 19px; background-color: #ecf2f5;">Chris</span></strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong><span style="color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 19px; background-color: #ecf2f5;">Sinjakli</span></strong>&nbsp;(@chrissinjo)&nbsp;is going to talk about better testing methods using Mutation Testing. We still need another speaker though, who's up for giving a talk? It doesn't need to be too long!&nbsp;</div>
<p />
<div>As also mentioned, I'm hoping to sort a curry night for Wednesday June 13th.. so let me know if you're interested in that.&nbsp;</div>
<p />
<p />
<div>Cheers!</div>
