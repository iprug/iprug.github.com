It's nearly July already (how did that happen?) so thoughts naturally turn to
the next IPRUG. As usual, it'll be on the first Tuesday (the 2nd), upstairs in
the Brewery Tap.

No volunteers to present this month (hint: start thinking of something you can
talk about in August!), so I'm going with Adam's suggestion of an informal hack
night. Bring your laptop and either hack on whatever you feel like or join
someone else who's doing something interesting.

Or just come along for the beer!
