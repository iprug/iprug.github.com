Happy new year everyone!

As it's still a bit close to the festive season to have sorted out things like
talks, I thought we'd just have a social meet-up this month. Usual time and
place (Tuesday 7 January at the Brewwwery Tap from 7pm), but just food, drink
and chat. And please have a think about whether there's anything you could talk
about in February.
