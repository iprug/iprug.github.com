<p>Hi Everyone,&nbsp;</p>
<div>Update: We now have 2 talks!</div>
<p />
<div>Matthew Robinson has offered to give a talk on an "<span style=""><span style="color: #000000;">Overview of Algorithms &amp; Karger&rsquo;s minimum cut algorithm".. "</span></span><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="">When dealing with large data sets, some algorithms are considerably faster than others. Graphs aka networks are relevant to many problems, such as determining "communities of interest" amongst Facebook friends. This talk will cover a clever way of tackling this sort of problem. It will also provide a brief overview of other useful fast algorithms based on those covered in&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.algo-class.org/" target="_blank" style="">www.algo-class.org</a></span>"</div>
<p />
<p />
<div>I'll be talking about Testing with Factory Girl. Factory Girl is a fantastic library that can make testing much easier. Thoughtbot recently released version 3 of it and it has lots of features you may or may not be using so I'll try to show off these.&nbsp;</div>
<p />
<div>Hope to see you then!</div>
