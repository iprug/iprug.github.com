Sorry for the late notice, but to avoid IPRUG being the day after FESuffolk we're going to move July's meeting back a couple of weeks, to Tuesday 15th.

As it looks like FESuffolk and IPRUG are semi-combining, with FESuffolk (which has a better venue for talks) covering more than just front end development and IPRUG becoming more of a general developer social meetup, what do people think of moving the usual date, to spread things out a bit? Maybe just make it a fortnight (plus a day) after FESuffolk, although "15 days after the last Monday in the month" might be a bit confusing.
