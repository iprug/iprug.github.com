Just over a fortnight to go until the next IPRUG, and as usual I haven't
organised anything yet, so I thought we'd go for another round of lightning
talks. That gives you a couple of weeks to think of something you can talk
about for five(ish) minutes. No fixed format &ndash; if you want to do it
[Ignite](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignite_(event) or [Pecha
Kucha](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pecha_Kucha) style that's fine, but so is a
simple five-minute talk. Subject-wise, anything that's at least tenuously
related to Ruby is fair game.

As usual it'll be the first Tuesday of the month (in this case 5 November) Also
as usual, we'll be at the [Brewery Tap](http://thebrewerytap.org/) from about
seven, with talks starting at half past (or get there earlier and partake of
one of their excellent burgers).
