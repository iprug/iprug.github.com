<p>Thanks to everyone for coming on Tuesday, it made for a great start to the year. Hopefully we'll see many more excellent presentations and some new faces as well as we convert Suffolk to the Ruby way. <p />The slides from the talks are available; <p /> Kerry Buckey's talk on RSpec <br /><iframe src="http://kerryb.github.com/iprug-rspec-presentation" height="400px" width="500px"></iframe><p />And Chris Sarginson on CouchDB</p>
