The results are in! There were some hard fought (read: drawn out and badly aimed) battles, and some excellent victories! There were tears, there were shouts of rage and there was a royal rumble at the end!<p />So! In first place; we have:<br /> <b>Anders Fisher, @atleastimtrying</b><p />In Second Place; we have:<br /><b>Dan Higham, @danhigham</b><p />Thanks to everyone for coming along and making it such a fun event, hopefully now we&#39;ve all got a bit of experience we can try it again in a few months, and be able to not bash into the walls quite as much. <p /> Tom<p /><br />Complete Results:<p /><div class="CodeRay">
