After a few months of IPRUG just being a social event, which only seemed to
appeal to a few of us (in fact just Leeky and me last month, although we had a
few more in March), we're going to try adding a more practical element back in
for April.

We [did ruby golf](http://iprug.org/2013/04/03/ruby-golf/) back in 2013 and
those that turned up seemed to enjoy it, so I'll put together some new "holes"
and we'll give it another go. We'll just be wherever we can get a table in the
pub rather than having a room to ourselves, but that shouldn't be a problem.
Bring a laptop or pair up with someone else.

Tuesday April 14th, 7pm at the Tap as usual.
