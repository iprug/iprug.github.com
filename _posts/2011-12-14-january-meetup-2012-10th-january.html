Woah, 2012, scary stuff. So for the first meetup of the new year we should have something suitably eventful! What would people like to see? Talk suggestions? A coding challenge perhaps? Or something entirely different? <p /> Entries on a Christmas card please! (Or a suitably festive email). <p />Please note that we are on the <b>SECOND</b> Tuesday of the month for this month only. So update your filofaxes to <b>January 10th 2012: 7:30  </b>at the brewery tap. <p /> <b>Ideas:</b><br />1) The Ruby Rogues did a show on Ruby Antipatterns.. that might be quite an interesting topic? <p />Cheers<p />Tom
