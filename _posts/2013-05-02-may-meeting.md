The next meeting is on Tuesday May 7th. We'll be upstairs in the Brewery Tap as
usual, meeting at around 7pm for a 7.30 start.

Adam's going to be talking about building an event processor in Ruby (a nice
change from the usual web apps), and I'll be trying to start a few arguments
about ruby style and idioms.

See you there!
