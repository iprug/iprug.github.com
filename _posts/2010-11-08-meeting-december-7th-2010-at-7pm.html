Welcome back for another instalment of IPRUG. This time we&#39;re going to do things a little different! In lieu of presentations, we&#39;re going to have us a Coding Dojo! <p />A Coding Dojo is a simple coding experiment where two people pair at a computer at a time for 5-10 minutes on a really simple problem and then we all move along one place. This way everyone gets to code, everyone gets to direct and hopefully everyone learns something; even if it is just how difficult coding can be under pressure! <p /> A bit more information can be found here:<br /><a href="http://codingdojo.org/">http://codingdojo.org/</a><p />Suggestions for problems to solve can be proposed to the google group at:<p /><a href="http://groups.google.com/group/iprug">http://groups.google.com/group/iprug</a><p /> I&#39;ll announce the problem a little closer to the time so we can all get a basic idea of what we&#39;ll be working on. <p /><b>The Schedule:<p /></b>7pm: Arrive, grab a beer. <br />7:30: Announce problem, grab first pair of coders. <br /> 7:35: Hack away! <br />8:30ish: Proceed back to the bar to drink and discuss how hard it was. <p /><b>Location:<p /></b>The Brewery Tap Pub, Ipswich. <p /><b>Sign Up!<p /><a href="http://lanyrd.com/2010/ipswich-ruby-user-group-december-meeting/">http://lanyrd.com/2010/ipswich-ruby-user-group-december-meeting/</a></b>
