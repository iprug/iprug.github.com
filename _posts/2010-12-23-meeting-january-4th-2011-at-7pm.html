<p>Hello IPRUGers! So it is with great excitement we move into a new year! I hope it brings happiness and good fortune to you all. <p />We kick off the first IPRUG of the new year with not one, but two presentations!&nbsp; Kerry and Chris have kindly offered to give presentations on <strong>Rspec</strong> and <strong>Couch DB</strong> respectively. <p /> Same format as usual, so meet at the Brewery Tap at 7ish and presentations kick off at 7:30. After we can have some beer and food. <p />Date: 4th Jan<br />Time: 7pm<br />Location: The Brewery Tap, Ipswich. <p />See you then!</p>
