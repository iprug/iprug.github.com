Hi Guys, <p /><div>So this will probably be the last time I write on here. I am moving to Cambridge and thus with a heavy heart, cannot run IPRUG anymore. It has been an amazing two years and I am so proud of what IPRUG has become. I&#39;ve heard some great talks, learnt far more about dhh than I could ever dream, and made some really good friends. So thank you all for your support and I hope you&#39;ll keep going what we started together. </div> <p /><div>Kerry Buckley has stepped up to be the new robot overlord of IPRUG, and I have no doubt he&#39;ll do an amazing job of it too knowing more about Ruby than any other living soul I know! Best of luck Kerry! </div> <p /><div>See you all soon!</div><p /><div>Tom </div>
