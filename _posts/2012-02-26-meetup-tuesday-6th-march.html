Hey Guys, <p />We&#39;ve had quite a few presentation meetups lately, and an excellent lightning talk session too, so by my reckoning it&#39;s about time for a coding challenge! <p /> I&#39;ve been having a bit of a think about this, and looked through some of the Ruby Quizzes, and this one looks like a lot of fun. We&#39;re going to implement... A Rogue[1] Walker! <p />The aim of this will be to explore the dungeons (supplied on the night) and escape in the fastest time possible. You will need to implement a class which displays the dungeon &amp; player on each step, and knows how to cope with the following elements:<p /> + = door ( the stairs may be behind a door)<br />~ = liquid (water =&gt; blue, lava =&gt; red, acid =&gt; green)<br /># = wall<br />&lt; = up stairs (back to the town)<br />&gt; = down stairs (deeper into the dungeon toward the exit)<br /> ^ = trap<br />* = gold (found in walls, ie ##*##)<br />X = Finish<p />Bonus points will be awarded for finding gold along the way, in the form of time deductions. <p /><br />See you at the next meetup!<p />Tom<p /> <br /> [1] <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue_%28video_game%29" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue_%28video_game%29</a><p /><p />Implementation Details:<p />1) You will be given a set of text files which will contain the dungeon layouts. So your walker will need to read these<br /> 2) You will need to explore each dungeon until you find the down stairs, you can only see where you have been and the squares immediately surrounding your walker.<br />3) Your time will finish once you have stepped onto the X square.
