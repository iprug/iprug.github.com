Yes, that's right, it's IPRUG *tomorrow night*! Even by my normal standards
I've been pretty disorganised this month, but the pub's booked and we have a
talk, so it could be worse.

[Chris](https://twitter.com/ChrisSinjo) will be talking about the perils of
dealing with dates and times in software.

No-one else volunteered to speak, so following Anders's suggestion we'll use
the rest of the time for a "ruby clinic". If you have a ruby question, or have
written some code that you think there's probably a better way to do, bring it
along and see if anyone can help. Failing that, more time for beer and
conversation.

See you tomorrow!
