Hi Everybody, <p />Thanks to all who came a long and participated last night, it was a great night and we had some really good battles! <br />Overall, Matthew Robinson was the victor! Matthew Bennett came in second and I finished third. <p /> All the entries are on Github, and hopefully will be pulled into the main repository:<br /><a href="https://github.com/MrJaba/battleship">https://github.com/MrJaba/battleship</a><p />Thanks again to everyone for making it such a fun evening.
