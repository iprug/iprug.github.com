<p>Hi, <p />I just wanted to say a massive thanks to all that came along to the Ruby Golf, it was great fun and I hope you all learnt as much as I did! I think we all had a bit of trouble with hole 7, and I just didn't have a clue about the Alternative Vote system, so hole 9 was a disaster for me! I thought I'd just post a few links to the solutions guys came up with:<p /> @Kerryb:<br /><a href="https://github.com/kerryb/rubygolf">https://github.com/kerryb/rubygolf</a></p>

<p>@MrJaba<br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/1074408.js"></script><p />give me a shout if you want yours linked to on here too. <p /> Damn alternative voting system :(<p />I think this could also be a nice idea for future IPRUGs, make them more code based and interactive as this was a lot of fun. Another big thanks to @andrewmcdonough for writing it!</p>
