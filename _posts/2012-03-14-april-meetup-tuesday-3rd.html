Hi Guys, <p /><div>The next meetup will be on April 3rd, meet at the Brewery Tap at 7pm onwards for talks to start at 7:30pm. </div><p /><div>I&#39;m still looking for speakers, at the moment we have no one lined up to talk! Is there a topic someone would like to talk on, or propose so someone else can cover it? Let me know in the comments, twitter, google group or on a postcard. </div> <p /><div>See you then!</div><p /><div>Tom</div>
