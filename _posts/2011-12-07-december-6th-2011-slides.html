<p>A massive thank you to everyone who braved the cold and the rain to come along to last night's meetup. A special thank you to Graham (@8bitscraps) for bringing his projector along, and another huge thank you to Matthew Robinson for his excellent if mind melting talk on Ruby's callcc and continuations, complete with sandwich making demonstration. <p /> The slides from both his and my talk are below.</p>
