<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong></p>
<p>So it seems that the most popular options is lightning talks! We'll follow the same format as LRUG, 20 slides each lasting a maximum of 20 seconds. So, step this way, step right up and volunteer to give a talk!</p>
<p>Talks so far:</p>
<p>@mrjaba - Backbone.js with Coffeescript</p>
<p>@stevewillbe - Rails 3.1 Asset Pipeline</p>
<p>@undecisive - Ray - a Ruby graphics library that can do 2d/3d graphics</p>
<p>@kerryb - as yet unnamed talk</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello once again! <p />  So the next IPRUG meeting will be as usual, at the tap and on the 2nd August (3 days before my birthday if anyone wants to buy me a pint to celebrate ;) The question as usual is what to talk about.&nbsp; I really enjoyed last months Ruby Golf, I think the practical format worked really well, so I'd be very keen to try something similar again and see if we have a repeat success. The alternatives are perhaps a lightning talk evening where we do a quick round of talks 20 slides, and each must take 20 seconds, or a usual IPRUG meeting. <p />  So, what would people prefer? <p />  1) Coding: I was thinking either the battle robots, or perhaps a maze solving ruby golf.<br /> 2) Lightning talks<br /> 3) Plain ol Talks. <p />  Hopefully we might see a few more people this month, so please spread the word far and wide! <p />  Cheers<p />  Tom</p>
