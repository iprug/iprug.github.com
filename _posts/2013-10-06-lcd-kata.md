Hopefully everyone had fun doing the LCD kata on Tuesday! I finally got round to [putting the code we ended up with](https://github.com/iprug/lcd-kata) on github (probably should have committed after each session, in retrospect).

I [had another go myself](https://github.com/kerryb/lcd-kata) at the weekend, but if you want to see how to do it properly, you could do a lot worse than watch [Corey Haines's screencast](http://vimeo.com/7076109).
