<p>Hi Guys,&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Update update!:</strong></p>
<p>Bit of a change to the schedule as I haven't had time to finish the code for my talk on Neo4J and so Matthew Applegate (@pixelh8) is kindly stepping in to give a talk on all manner of exciting music based hacking!</p>
<p><span style="font-family: mceinline;"><strong>Update</strong>:</span></p>
<div>Talk 1: Tom Crinson on using Neo4J to determine news item's popularity from Twitter.</div>
<div>Talk 2: Kerry Buckley talking about 7 Languages in 7 Weeks</div>
<p />
<div>It's that time again! I need some "volunteers" to speak at the IPRUG next month! Does anyone have anything they've built recently that they'd like to share? Or something they've learnt?&nbsp;</div>
<p />
<div>The meetup will be on:</div>
<p />
<div><strong>Tuesday May 1st, at 7:30pm</strong>&nbsp;at the Brewery Tap</div>
<p />
<div>I'm hoping I might have have a talk prepared on using Neo4J in Ruby to determine news items' popularity, would that be of interest?&nbsp;</div>
<p />
<p />
<div>Cheers</div>
<p />
<div>Tom</div>
