Firstly, sorry (again) about the web site being missing for so long. After
renewing the domain, the DNS stopped working, and thanks to my general laziness
and incompetence it took a month to get it sorted.

Anyway, there's now less than a week to go until the next meeting -- Tuesday 3
August, 7pm for a 7.30 start, at the Brewery Tap. We've got two talks lined up:
Sean Dunn on rails development workflow with tmux, pry etc (originally planned
for last month, but foiled by Sean getting a puncture on his way to the pub);
and some kind of half-formed wittering from me (Kerry) about trying a more
functional style in Ruby. I say half-formed -- getting as far as half is kind
of an aspiration at the moment, but hopefully I'll have something by Tuesday.

Hope to see you there!
