<p>Another IPRUG awaits you intrepid rubyists! It will be on <strong>Tuesday 1st March 7:30pm</strong> at the Brewery Tap Ipswich as always. <p />This month we will have 2 more exciting talks,<strong> Dan Higham</strong> (@danhigham) has offered to give a talk on <strong>CoffeeScript</strong>, and <strong>Steve Butterworth</strong> (@the_tech_expert) has offered to give a talk <strong>"Idea to app in 1 month. My story."</strong> in which he will explain the App, the stack used, API's etc<strong></strong>.&nbsp; I am already looking forward to both. <p /> So, rock up @theipswichtap from around 7ish and grab a beer by the nice fire and we'll kick off the talks about 7:30. <p />See you there!<p />MrJaba</p>
