Thanks to everyone who came along last night for what was hopefully an enjoyable game of "Peril" (aka Jeopary), despite me not only leaving the buzzers at work, but not remembering they were at work until Leeky had kindly given me a lift home to get them.

If anyone's interested in the Peril rails app, you can find [my fork on github](https://github.com/kerryb/peril) &ndash; I just added a few tweaks to the original which James Edward Gray II wrote for LoneStarRuby Conference 2013.

We'll hopefully be back to the normal format of a couple of talks (or some practical activity) next month &ndash; any volunteers?
