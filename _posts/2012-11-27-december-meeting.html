The next IPRUG meeting is on Tuesday 4 December, in the <a href="http://thebrewerytap.org/">Brewery Tap</a>. As usual, turn up around seven (or earlier if you&#39;re planning on sampling the famous burgers or cheesy chips beforehand!), and the talks will start upstairs at around 7.30.<p /><div>We have two talks going back to Ruby basics this month – <a href="https://twitter.com/MrJaba">Tom</a> on what&#39;s new in Ruby 2.0, and <a href="https://twitter.com/kerryb">me</a> on some stuff that&#39;s not new, but that you might not have come across (AKA random ruby nooks and crannies). Which means I really ought to start preparing…</div> <p /><div>Hope to see you there!</div><p /><div>Kerry</div>
