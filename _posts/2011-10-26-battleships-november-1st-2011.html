Hi everybody, <p />following in LRUG&#39;s footsteps once more, this month we will be participating in some warfare on the high seas! Yes it&#39;s the classic game, Battleships.  <p />Rules and details are at: <p /> <a href="https://github.com/threedaymonk/battleship">https://github.com/threedaymonk/battleship</a><p />We will do the coding on the night, so get down for 7pm and we&#39;ll get started as soon as we can as I think this might be quite a tricky one. Please feel free to research this one as there&#39;s some quite complicated approaches that can be taken. <p /> Details:<p />Tuesday November 1st, 7pm<p />The Brewery Tap, Ipswich<p />See you there!
