After last month's ruby golf, we're back to just a social beer-and-chat night
next month. Tuesday 12 May in the Brewery Tap as usual.

We're piggybacking on the Suffolk Developers Meetup site, so you can RSVP
[there](http://www.meetup.com/Suffolk-Developers/events/222152987/) if you want
(or just turn up).

Open to suggestions for something to do in June!
