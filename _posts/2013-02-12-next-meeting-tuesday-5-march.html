<p>As usual we'll be meeting on the first Tuesday of the month, which is 5 March, 7pm for a 7.30 start. Unlike those crazy FE Suffolk guys with their new venue, we'll still be at the Brewery Tap.</p>
<p>This month we're doing lightning talks, and it would be good if as many people as possible could do one. So start thinking now about something you can do a very quick talk about &ndash; it's up do you whether you just want to do a straight five-minute talk, or try the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pecha_Kucha">Pecha Kucha</a> format of 20 slides, with 20 seconds per slide (preferably auto-advancing).</p>
<p>Once you've decided what you're going to talk about, please let us know on the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/iprug">mailing list</a>.</p>
<p>See you in three weeks!</p>
<p><strong>Talks confirmed so far:</strong></p>
<p>Steve Butterworth: <em>Big Data, quick wins with RoR</em> &ndash; How to use a vanilla Rails setup top process large amounts of data</p>
