Hello! <p /> Next month will be the first IPRUG that I'm supposed to be organising, <br />but fortunately Tom will still be around so hopefully I won't forget <br />to do anything important. <p /> We've got two talks pencilled in, from Max Shelley (@maxshelley) and <br />Frank Carver (@efficacy). If you guys let me know the talk titles I'll <br />update the page (assuming I can figure out how). <p /> Usual time and place – 7.30pm at the Brewery Tap. Hope to see you all there! <p /> Kerry
