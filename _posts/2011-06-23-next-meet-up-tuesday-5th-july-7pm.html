<p>Hello! A huge thanks to Steve for running the last iprug, I hear it went down extremely well. <p /> For the next month's it's been generally decided by a whole 3 of us, we'd like to try something new, so we'll be trying the Ruby Golf that LRUG did recently and seemed to go down a storm. <p /> So, come along with your laptops to the brewery tap on the 5th July and we'll do some hacking! <p /> You'll need; <br />Laptop, <br />Ruby 1.8.7 <br />Rspec 1.3 <p /> See you then!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>UPDATE:</p>
<p>So to get this running on your laptop (In case of internet connection issues);</p>
<p>[code]


git clone git://github.com/andrewmcdonough/rubygolf.git 
cd rubygolf
rvm use ruby-1.8.7
bundle install
rake


[/code]</p>
<p>And this should have you up and running!</p>
<p>Other things you might want are;</p>
