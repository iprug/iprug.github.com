No talk volunteers again this month (hint hint), so let's do some coding! I'm going with Adam's suggestion to do a [coding dojo](http://codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?RandoriKata) type thing again. Is it really almost three years since [we did that before](/2010/11/08/meeting-december-7th-2010-at-7pm/)?

I'll pick a kata and we can rotate round doing paired TDD on the projector (don't worry, no-one'll pick on your code)

Usual time and place -- 7pm for 7.30 start in the Brewery Tap. Tuesday 1 October. **Note that we'll be in the Tolly Room (downstairs) this month.**
