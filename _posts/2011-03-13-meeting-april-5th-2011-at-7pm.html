<p>This month's meeting will take place on <strong>April 5th at 7pm at the Brewery Tap</strong> in Ipswich.</p>
<p>2 Speakers have now been found so we're on for another full night!</p>
<p>The first talk will be Dan Higham on Helping with Enginyard University, the second talk will be from Matthew Bennett who will be presenting on the Ruby-esque Mirah written by Charles Nutter. Very exciting! Thanks to both the guys for volunteering, and very much looking forward to hearing them both.</p>
<p><br /><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">So far we have an offer of a talk from Dan Higham on Helping Engineyard with Ruby University, but we could use one more talk if anyone is willing?</span><br /><span style="text-decoration: line-through;"> If we don't have any offers or suggestions, I could always give a quick talk on writing a music visualizer in Ruby with Processing if people would find that interesting? </span><p />So, as usual 7pm come meet and grab a beer, and we will kick off at 7:30pm</p>
