<p>The next meeting will be on the first Tuesday of the month as usual, which is 2 April. Meet at the Brewery Tap at around 7pm for a 7.30 start.</p>
<p>We'll be doing Ruby golf again this month, so forget everything you know about writing maintainable code, bring your laptop and see how low you can score! Don't worry if you're not that familiar with Ruby &ndash; there will be plenty of people you can pair up with so you'll still be able to have fun and hopefully learn something at the same time.</p>
<p>Here's <a href="https://github.com/kerryb/iprug-rubygolf-2013">everything you need</a> to get ready beforehand &ndash; the actual specs for the holes will be provided on the night so no-one gets a head start. You might also want to grab an offline copy of the <a href="https://github.com/metamorfos/ruby-doc-1.9.3/archive/master.zip">Ruby 1.9.3 core API docs</a>&nbsp;[ZIP file].</p>
