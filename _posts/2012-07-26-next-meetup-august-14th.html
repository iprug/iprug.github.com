Hi Everyone, <p /><p /><div>So this meetup will be a bit more of a relaxed affair, it&#39;s IPRUG&#39;s 2nd birthday and to celebrate I think we should have a nice social meetup where we can go to the tap and have a drink and maybe some birthday cake, talk some Ruby or whatever else tickles your fancy, but it&#39;d be great to see you all there. Please note that it&#39;s the 2nd Tuesday of the month this time as I&#39;ll be away on the first one. </div> <p /><p /><div>7:30pm @ the Brewery Tap, Ipswich, August 14th. </div><p /><p /><div>See you then!</div><p /><p /><div>Tom</div>
