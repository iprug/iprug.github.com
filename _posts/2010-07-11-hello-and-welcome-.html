Hello!<p />This is the site of the brand new IPRUG, the Ipswich Ruby User Group, where we shall discuss all things Ruby and Ruby Related (or anything technical and interesting really).  The aim will be to have monthly or bi-monthly meetings at a pub, give presentations, network, drink beer and generally be jolly. <p /> Please join the Google Group at <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/iprug">http://groups.google.com/group/iprug</a> say hello, introduce yourself and we can kick off some discussions and ideas for talks and presentations.<p /> Dates for the first meet-up will be announced soon on both this site and the Google Group, so stay tuned. <p />Again, welcome and I look forward to meeting you all. <p /><br />MrJaba
