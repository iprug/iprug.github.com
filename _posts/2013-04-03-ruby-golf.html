<p>I think a combination of illness, the weather and the Easter holidays probably conspired to keep a lot of people away last night, but those of us that did turn up had fun writing really horrible (but short) Ruby to solve the ruby golf problems.</p>
<p>I'm afraid I wasn't organised enough to note down everyone's scores, but Matthew Robinson was the winner, being the only person other than me to complete all nine holes (and I'd already written the code once to make sure the tests passed, so I disqualified myself).</p>
<p>I've added the specs to the <a href="https://github.com/kerryb/iprug-rubygolf-2013">github repo</a> so you can have a go yourself if you missed it. To recreate the full experience I suggest you sit round a tiny table in a cold room with a pint. There's also a <a href="https://github.com/kerryb/iprug-rubygolf-2013/tree/solution">branch with my solutions</a> to give you something to beat (my total was 834 for the nine holes).</p>
