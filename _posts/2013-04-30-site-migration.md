With ... oh, several hours to go until Posterous Pages shuts down, I've
switched to a static site generated with
[Jekyl Bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/).
If you're reading this, I guess it worked.

Hopefully I've got all the redirects right so links to pages on the old site
will still work. Perhaps one day I'll get round to adding some styling!
