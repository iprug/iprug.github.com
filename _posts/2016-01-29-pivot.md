If you've come to Iprug at all in the past few months (years?), it can't have
escaped your notice that attendance since we stopped doing talks has got a bit
... thin. Average turnout these days is somewhere around three, which isn't
really sustainable.

I was going to suggest take a break for a bit, then maybe trying to start it up
again in a different format, make more effort to come up with practical things
to do, or even figure out a way of going back to talks without having to
project slides onto a painting of a fox. However, thanks to an idea from
Richard Astbury we now have a better plan!

Starting next month (February), we're going to co-opt Iprug for a Suffolk
Developers study group, starting with [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/) and
[Phoenix](http://www.phoenixframework.org/) (combined with discussions in the
[#study_group](https://suffolkdevs.slack.com/messages/study_group/details/)
Slack channel.

If you haven't come across the language before, here are the resources some of
us have already been looking at:

* [Programming Elixir](https://pragprog.com/book/elixir/programming-elixir) book
* [Programming Phoenix](https://pragprog.com/book/phoenix/programming-phoenix) book (beta)
* [Études for Elixir](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000001642) ebook (free!)
* [Awesome Elixir](https://github.com/h4cc/awesome-elixir) – a curated list of links

We'll still be meeting in the Brewery Tap at sevenish for beer and burgers, but
on a Thursday instead of a Tuesday. Keep an eye on
[Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Suffolk-Developers/) for future meeting details.

So, that's **Thursday 11 February**, from around **7pm** in the **Brewery Tap**.
Bring your laptop and we can figure out how we can all help each other to learn
the next cool language See you there!
