Firstly, sorry about the web site being off the air for a while. The domain renewal has finally gone through and all is well again.

One week to go until the next meeting -- Tuesday 6 August, 7pm for a 7.30 start, at the Brewery Tap. We've got two talks lined up: Sean Dunn on rails development workflow with tmux, pry etc; and Adam Whittingham on concurrency models.

Hope to see you there!
