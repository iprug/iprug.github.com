Just over a week to go until the February meeting, and we have two talks planned. [Leeky](https://twitter.com/leeky) will be talking about graph databases, and [Kerry](https://twitter.com/kerryb) will be telling you how to get the most out of rake.

Usual time and place &ndash; 7pm for a 7.30 start at the Brewery Tap (earlier if you want to sample one of their excellent burgers first).
