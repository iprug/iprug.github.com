<p>&hellip;and the apocalypse doesn't come on Friday, we're meeting up for some combined IPRUG/FESuffolk pre-Christmas drinks on Saturday the 22nd. See you at 7pm in the Brewery Tap!</p>
<p>As far as regular IPRUG nights go, the January meeting will be a week later than usual, on the 8th. We still need speakers &ndash; any volunteers?</p>
