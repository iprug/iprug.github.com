<p>Ipswich Ruby User Group is a group that meets to discuss the latest and greatest in the Ruby Community. That and we drink beer and like a good chat about all things technical.</p>
<p>We meet at the <a href="http://thebrewerytap.org/">Brewery Tap</a> on the first Tuesday of each month, at 7pm for a 7.30 start. There are usually two talks, or sometimes a bit of hands-on programming, followed by some nice geeky conversation at the bar. Everyone welcome, regardless of how much or little Ruby experience you may have (and whether or not you drink beer).</p>
<p>Contact <a href="mailto:kerryjbuckley@gmail.com">Kerry</a> for more information (and especially if you'd like to volunteer to give a talk).</p>
<p>Join the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/iprug">Google group</a> to keep up-to-date.</p>
