<p>Ipswich Ruby User Group was set up to discuss the latest and greatest in the
Ruby Community (and to get together for beer and burgers and a good chat about
all things technical).</p>

<p>Since then several other tech groups have sprung up in Ipswich, and we've
now semi-merged with <a href="http://fesuffolk.co.uk">FESuffolk</a>. The talks
(including Ruby, and not just front end-related) happen on the traditional
FESuffolk night (the UCS venue is much more suitable), and what was IPRUG is
now a general social meetup for any kind of developers. We might do some
hands-on hacky type things sometimes &ndash; we'll see.</p>

<p>We meet at the <a href="http://thebrewerytap.org/">Brewery Tap</a> one
Tuesday a month, two weeks after FESuffolk. That makes it 15 days after the
last Monday in the month, but it's much easier to just work it out based on the
FESuffolk date!</p>

<p>Now there aren't any formal talks, it doesn't really matter what time you
turn up, but there'll probably be people there from 6.30 or 7 pm.</p>
